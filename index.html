    <h2>RagDoll</h2>
    <img src="images\ragdoll.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400">
    <p>The Ragdoll is a cat breed with a colour point coat and striking blue eyes. Their form is large and muscular and their coat is silky soft and semi-longhair. Ragdolls were developed by American breeder Ann Baker in the 1960s. They are best known for their docile and placid temperament and affectionate nature. The name 'Ragdoll' is derived from the tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up.
      Ragdolls are powerful, large and heavy cats that are distinguishable by their V-shape markings on their forehead, large round blue eyes, soft thick coat, thick limbs, long tail and soft bodies. Their colourings are commonly tri-colour or bi-colour.
      Cats of the Ragdoll breed have bold personalities, a relaxed nature and a strong tolerance for pain (though this can, at times, be mistaken for lack of pain). These features allow Ragdolls to tolerate children's play and makes the breed an ideal family pet.

      <p>
        The Siberian is a centuries-old landrace (natural variety) of domestic cat in Russia and recently developed as a formal breed with standards promulgated the world over since the late 1980s.
        Siberians vary from medium to medium-large in size. The formal name of the breed is Siberian Forest Cat, but usually it's simply called the Siberian or Siberian cat. Another formal breed name is the Moscow Semi-Longhair. The cat is an ancient breed that is now believed to be ancestral to all modern long-haired cats. The cat has similarities with the Norwegian forest cat, to which it is likely closely related. It is a natural breed from Siberia and the national cat of Russia. While it began as a landrace, it is selectively bred and pedigreed today in at least seven major cat fancier and breeder organizations.

      <h2>Munchkin</h2>
      <img src="images\munchkin.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400">
      <p>The Munchkin cat or Sausage cat is a relatively new breed of cat characterized by its very short legs, which are caused by genetic mutation. The Munchkin is considered to be the original breed of dwarf cat.
        The Munchkin is a small to medium-size cat weighing 5 to 9 pounds. Other than his short legs, he resembles any other cat, with a short or long coat, either of which can be just about any color or pattern.
        The Munchkin is well suited to any home with people who will love him and care for him. Keep him indoors to protect him from cars, diseases spread by other cats, and attacks from other animals and he can live 13 years or longer.

      <h2>British Short Hair</h2>
      <img src="images\british_shorthair.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400">
      <p>The British Shorthair is the pedigreed version of the traditional British domestic cat, with a distinctively stocky body, dense coat, and broad face. The most familiar colour variant is the "British Blue", with a solid grey-blue coat, orange eyes, and a medium-sized tail. The breed has also been developed in a wide range of other colours and patterns, including tabby and colourpoint.
        The breed's good-natured appearance and relatively calm temperament make it a frequent media star, notably as the inspiration for John Tenniel's famous illustration of the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. The Cat Fanciers' Association profile reads: "When gracelessness is observed, the British Shorthair is duly embarrassed, quickly recovering with a 'Cheshire cat smile.
